# StackOverflow-lite
This web application is a `lite` weight version the popular [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com) branch of the same name. It uses the popular JavaScript runtime environment, `NodeJs` and runs `express` at the backend.
All codes are written in `ES6` syntax and transpiled using the BabelCLI to a preset `ES2015`. 

## The User Interface
This part of the project is the graphical part of the app constructed with `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. It is concerned with all that the user can see/view whenever they visit the web app. 

### Some of the features include:
- Viewing `recently posted questions` on the platform.
- A list of questions they recently posted on the platform and the question count.
- A `sign up` and `Log In` form to be used appropriately.
- A `profile page` for users with account, e.t.c
